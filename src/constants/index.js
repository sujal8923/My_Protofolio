export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello! I’m Sujal, a front-end web developer with a passion for crafting intuitive and dynamic user experiences. Currently, I’m pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and I  am in third year.

My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how websites are built, and that curiosity has transformed into a commitment to creating beautiful, responsive designs. I specialize in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS, and I’m always eager to learn more.

I believe that great web design combines functionality with creativity, and I strive to achieve that in every project I undertake. Whether it's building a simple landing page or a complex application, I aim to deliver solutions that are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly.

When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, participating in coding challenges, or collaborating on open-source projects. I’m excited about the future of web development and look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals.

Let’s create something amazing together!.`;
