A passionate and self-driven Software Developer with hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development.
Skilled in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces using React.js, HTML, and CSS, and building robust backend
systems with Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. Strong interest in developing practical solutions to real-world problems
and contributing to collaborative, tech-driven environments.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello! I’m Sujal, a full-stack web developer with a strong passion for building scalable, intuitive, and dynamic user experiences. I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and am in my final year.

My journey into web development began with curiosity about how websites and applications work — and over time, it has evolved into a deep interest in creating end-to-end solutions. I specialize in both frontend and backend technologies, allowing me to build complete, responsive, and robust applications from scratch.

On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS to craft clean, modern UIs. On the backend, I use Java with Spring Boot to build RESTful APIs, handle authentication and authorization, and manage relational databases like MySQL. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and ensuring seamless communication between frontend and backend systems.

Whether it’s building a simple landing page or a full-stack web app, I strive to deliver solutions that are both user-centric and performance-optimized. I’m also enthusiastic about learning new tools, participating in hackathons, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up to date with industry trends.

Let’s connect and create something impactful together!
